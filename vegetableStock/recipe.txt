Add the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and bay leaf to a large pot.
Pour in the water, covering the vegetables, and bring to a boil.
Lower heat to a simmer and cook uncovered for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Add the fresh herbs (rosemary is my favourite) in the last 10 minutes of cooking.
Strain the stock, discard the vegetables, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
